COMP 20 Lab 9
Messages - Part 2
by Hazen Breen

Part 2:
The page and heading "Messages" loads, but the messages are not displayed, since the data.json file is not on the same server.
Therefore, the XMLHttpRequest cannot load data.json because it would be a cross origin request. An error describing this
is displayed on the console.

Part 3:
The page and heading "Messages" loads, but the messages are not displayed. No errors are displayed on the console.

Summary:
Both part 2 and part 3 show that it is not possible to request data from a different origin.


Implementation:
Everything in this assignment is implemented correctly.


Collaboration:
On this assignmnet I collaborated with Jordan Stone, specifically in figuring out the basics of XMLHttpRequest.

Time:
I spent approximately 3 hours on this assignment.
